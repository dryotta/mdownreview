## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Open file in tab
The application SHALL open a file in a new tab when the user selects it, displaying its content in the viewer area. If the file is already open in an existing tab, the application SHALL activate that tab instead of opening a duplicate.

#### Scenario: Open new file
- **WHEN** the user selects a file from the folder tree
- **THEN** a new tab appears in the tab bar with the file's name, and the file's content is displayed in the viewer

#### Scenario: Activate existing tab
- **WHEN** the user selects a file that is already open in a tab
- **THEN** the existing tab becomes active and no duplicate tab is created

### Requirement: Switch between open tabs
The application SHALL allow the user to switch between open tabs by clicking on a tab in the tab bar. The active tab SHALL be visually distinguished from inactive tabs.

#### Scenario: Switch tab
- **WHEN** the user clicks on an inactive tab
- **THEN** that tab becomes active and its content is displayed in the viewer area

#### Scenario: Active tab indicator
- **WHEN** a tab is active
- **THEN** it is visually highlighted (e.g., bold text, underline, or background change) to distinguish it from inactive tabs

### Requirement: Close a tab
The application SHALL allow the user to close an open tab. When the last tab is closed, the viewer SHALL display an empty state. When a non-last tab is closed, the adjacent tab SHALL become active.

#### Scenario: Close tab via close button
- **WHEN** the user clicks the close button (×) on a tab
- **THEN** the tab is removed from the tab bar and its content is no longer shown

#### Scenario: Close last tab
- **WHEN** the user closes the only remaining open tab
- **THEN** the viewer area shows an empty/welcome state with no content

#### Scenario: Close active tab with siblings
- **WHEN** the user closes the currently active tab and other tabs remain open
- **THEN** the next adjacent tab becomes active

### Requirement: File type detection and viewer routing
The application SHALL detect the file type from the file extension and route it to the appropriate viewer: markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) to the Markdown viewer, all other text files to the source/plain-text viewer. Binary files SHALL display a message indicating they cannot be displayed.

#### Scenario: Open markdown file
- **WHEN** the user opens a file with a `.md` or `.mdx` extension
- **THEN** the Markdown viewer renders the content with formatted output

#### Scenario: Open source code file
- **WHEN** the user opens a file with a recognized source code extension (e.g., `.ts`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.json`)
- **THEN** the source viewer displays the content with syntax highlighting

#### Scenario: Open plain text file
- **WHEN** the user opens a `.txt` or unrecognized text-based file
- **THEN** the source viewer displays the raw text content

#### Scenario: Open binary file
- **WHEN** the user opens a file detected as binary (e.g., image, executable)
- **THEN** a message is shown: "This file cannot be displayed"

### Requirement: Display file name in tab
Each tab SHALL display the file's base name (not the full path). The full path SHALL be visible in a tooltip on hover.

#### Scenario: Tab label shows base name
- **WHEN** a file is opened in a tab
- **THEN** the tab label shows only the file's base name (e.g., `README.md`, not the full path)

#### Scenario: Full path on hover
- **WHEN** the user hovers over a tab
- **THEN** a tooltip shows the file's full absolute path

### Requirement: Scroll position per tab
The application SHALL preserve the scroll position for each open tab independently. Switching tabs SHALL restore the scroll position for the activated tab.

#### Scenario: Independent scroll state
- **WHEN** the user scrolls in one tab and then switches to another tab and back
- **THEN** the first tab's scroll position is restored to where it was left

### Requirement: Keyboard shortcut to cycle tabs
The application SHALL support keyboard shortcuts to navigate between open tabs (next tab: `Ctrl+Tab` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+}` on macOS; previous tab: `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+{` on macOS).

#### Scenario: Next tab shortcut
- **WHEN** the user presses the next-tab shortcut
- **THEN** focus moves to the next tab (wrapping from last to first)

#### Scenario: Previous tab shortcut
- **WHEN** the user presses the previous-tab shortcut
- **THEN** focus moves to the previous tab (wrapping from first to last)
