# AGENTS.md — mdownreview

Context for AI agents working on this codebase.

## What This Is

A slim and fast desktop app written in Rust and React for browsing, viewing and reviewing markdown, code and other text files on Windows and macOS. Users open folders of `.md`/`.mdx` files, read and navigate them, and attach inline review comments. The app is a **viewer/reviewer, not an editor**.

Primary users are developers who receive batches of files from AI tools and need to read, navigate, and annotate them without a full editing environment.

## Non-Goals

Do not implement these — they are explicitly out of scope:

- Editing file content
- Git integration, diff views, or version history
- Cloud sync or real-time collaboration
- Plugin/extension system
- Remote log shipping or telemetry
- Log viewer UI inside the app
- Linux `.desktop` file association
- File type associations other than `.md`/`.mdx`
- Visual regression/snapshot tests
- 100% line coverage (focus on high-value scenarios)

## Constraints

- Runs on Windows 10+ and macOS 12+ without a GPU requirement
- Fully offline — no network calls except system browser links
- Comments persist locally alongside reviewed files (no database)
- File associations registered per-user (no UAC elevation on Windows)
- All tests must run headlessly in CI

## Architecture

Two runtime layers bridged by Tauri v2:

**Rust layer** (`src-tauri/src/`)
- File I/O via custom commands — `read_text_file`, `read_dir` — that bypass `tauri-plugin-fs` scope restrictions (intentional for local-only viewer). Guarded by 10 MB size limit and null-byte binary detection. `read_dir` filters out `.review.yaml` and `.review.json` sidecars.
- Comment persistence: `save_review_comments` / `load_review_comments` write MRSF v1.0 YAML sidecar files alongside each reviewed document. Loads YAML first, falls back to JSON for backward compatibility.
- File watcher: `watcher.rs` uses `notify-debouncer-mini` (300ms) to watch directories containing open files. Emits `file-changed` events with `content | review | deleted` kinds.
- Orphan scanner: `scan_review_files` walks a directory tree to find `.review.json` sidecars, used for ghost entry detection (capped at 10K results).
- CLI arg handling: parsed in `setup` hook, stored in `Arc<Mutex<Option<LaunchArgs>>>`, consumed via `get_launch_args` command (poll on mount, not event push — eliminates the race where events fire before React's first `useEffect`).
- Logging: `tauri-plugin-log` routes both Rust `tracing` macros and WebView `console.*` calls to a single rotating log file.

**React/TypeScript layer** (`src/`)
- State: Zustand with six slices — `workspaceSlice` (root folder, tree state), `tabsSlice` (open tabs, scroll positions), `commentsSlice` (comments by file path), `uiSlice` (theme, pane widths), `updateSlice` (auto-update state), `watcherSlice` (ghost entries, auto-reveal, save timestamp).
- Viewers: `MarkdownViewer` (react-markdown + remark-gfm + @shikijs/rehype + rehype-slug), `SourceViewer` (Shiki direct API), `BinaryPlaceholder`.
- All Tauri calls go through `src/lib/tauri-commands.ts` typed wrappers — never call `invoke` directly in components or hooks.
- All logging goes through `src/logger.ts` — never import `@tauri-apps/plugin-log` directly.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Custom Tauri commands bypass `tauri-plugin-fs` scope** (intentional — local viewer). `read_text_file` rejects files >10 MB and detects binary via first-512-byte null scan.
2. **`MD_COMPONENTS` defined at module scope** (never inside render). Per-block IDs use `node.position.start.line` from react-markdown's `node` prop. Prevents React error #185 in concurrent mode.
3. **Comments as MRSF v1.0 sidecars** — `<filename>.review.yaml` (primary) or `.review.json` (legacy fallback) in the same directory. Uses the open [Sidemark/MRSF specification](https://sidemark.org/specification.html) for interoperability with VS Code's Sidemark extension. Portable alongside files; no database.
4. **Anchor by selected text + line number** — MRSF `selected_text` with SHA-256 hash and line/column anchors. 4-step re-anchoring algorithm (exact text → line fallback → fuzzy match → orphan) survives AI refactoring.
5. **Poll for first-instance CLI args** via `get_launch_args` command (not an event). Events can fire before React's first `useEffect`; the command is called on mount after React commits, eliminating the race. Second-instance args use `args-received` event (safe because the window is already running).
6. **Unified Shiki** for both `MarkdownViewer` fenced blocks and `SourceViewer`. Using two different highlighters would produce inconsistent code themes.
7. **Zustand persist middleware** serializes only UI state (tab scroll positions, workspace root, theme preference) — not comment content, which lives in sidecar files.
8. **`window.onerror` / `window.onunhandledrejection` installed at module level in `main.tsx`**, before `ReactDOM.createRoot()`, so errors during initial render and module loading are captured.
9. **Single `src/__mocks__/@tauri-apps/api/core.ts`** for `invoke`. Mock return values are typed against interfaces from `tauri-commands.ts` — TypeScript validates them at compile time.
10. **Vitest over Jest** — shares Vite config, handles ESM-only packages (react-markdown, shiki) without extra transform configuration.

## Testing Conventions

- **Vitest** for unit and component tests. `test-setup.ts` spies on `console.error` and `console.warn` in every test — unexpected calls fail the test. Tests that intentionally trigger errors must suppress the spy with `mockImplementation(() => {})`.
- **Playwright** E2E imports `{ test, expect }` from `e2e/fixtures/index.ts` — not from `@playwright/test` directly. The fixture attaches `pageerror` and `console` error collectors; any uncaught error fails the test.
- **Rust** integration tests in `src-tauri/tests/commands_integration.rs`.
- Dev-server E2E (`npm run test:e2e`) targets the Vite dev server with Tauri IPC mocked. Native binary tests (`npm run test:e2e:native`) are a pre-release manual gate.
- **A task is NOT complete until `cargo test`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:e2e` all pass.**

## Log File

Release builds write to `{appDataDir}/logs/mdownreview.log`. Rotation at 5 MB, max 3 files. Log level `info` in release, `debug` in debug builds. WebView `console.log/debug` suppressed in release (only `warn`/`error` forwarded). Path exposed in the About dialog with a "Copy path" button.

## Comment Data Model (MRSF v1.0)

Uses the [Markdown Review Sidecar Format (MRSF) v1.0](https://sidemark.org/specification.html) — an open standard for review comments stored alongside documents. Compatible with VS Code's Sidemark extension.

**Sidecar file:** `<filename>.review.yaml` (primary) or `.review.json` (legacy read-only)

```yaml
mrsf_version: "1.0"
document: "filename.ext"        # Relative path to reviewed file
comments:
  - id: "uuid"                  # Required: unique identifier
    author: "Display Name (id)" # Required: "Name (identifier)" format
    timestamp: "2025-04-15T10:00:00Z"  # Required: RFC 3339
    text: "Comment text"        # Required: comment body
    resolved: false             # Required: resolution status
    # Anchor fields (optional):
    line: 42                    # 1-based line number
    end_line: 45                # End line for multi-line selections
    start_column: 10            # 0-based start column
    end_column: 30              # 0-based end column
    selected_text: "code here"  # Selected text for re-anchoring
    selected_text_hash: "sha256..."  # SHA-256 of selected_text
    # Metadata (optional):
    type: "suggestion"          # suggestion | issue | question | accuracy | style | clarity
    severity: "low"             # low | medium | high
    reply_to: "parent-uuid"     # Threading: references parent comment ID
    commit: "abc1234"           # Git commit SHA at comment creation
```

### Threading

Flat `reply_to` model — replies are top-level comments with `reply_to` referencing the parent comment's `id`. No nested `responses[]` array (v3 format removed).

### Re-anchoring Algorithm (4-step)

1. **Exact match**: Find `selected_text` at original line, then search full document
2. **Line fallback**: If line number is still in bounds, anchor there
3. **Fuzzy match**: Levenshtein similarity ≥ 0.6, prefer closest to original line
4. **Orphan**: All strategies failed — comment displayed with orphan banner

### Surviving AI Refactoring

1. **MRSF anchoring** with 4-step re-anchoring (exact text → line → fuzzy → orphan)
2. **Sidecar files** (`<filename>.review.yaml`) travel alongside source files
3. **Ghost entries**: when a file is deleted but its sidecar remains, the folder tree shows a strikethrough entry and the DeletedFileViewer displays orphaned comments
4. **File watcher**: Rust `notify` crate watches open files + sidecars with 300ms debounce, auto-reloading content and comments when the AI makes changes
5. **Save-loop prevention**: 1.5s debounce guard after app saves prevents watcher → reload → save cycles

## File Watcher

Rust-side watcher (`src-tauri/src/watcher.rs`) using `notify-debouncer-mini`:
- Watches directories containing open files (not individual files)
- Emits `file-changed` Tauri events with `{path, kind}` where kind is `content | review | deleted`
- Frontend `useFileWatcher` hook syncs open tabs to watcher, dispatches DOM `CustomEvent`s
- `useFileContent` hook re-reads file on content changes
- Viewers reload comments on review sidecar changes
- `scan_review_files` command walks directory tree to find orphan sidecars (capped at 10K)

## Folder Tree Enhancements

- **Auto-reveal**: 📍 toggle (persisted) expands tree path and scrolls to active file on tab switch
- **Auto-root**: when no workspace is open, tree root auto-sets to parent dir of active file
- **Ghost entries**: deleted files with review sidecars appear with strikethrough
- **Comment badges**: files show unresolved comment count (numeric badge, not just a dot)
- **Hidden sidecars**: `.review.yaml` and `.review.json` files are filtered from `read_dir` results
