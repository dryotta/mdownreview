# Expert Review Skill

You are orchestrating a multi-expert review of the mdownreview codebase. Run all experts in parallel, collect their findings, synthesize a single prioritized improvement plan, and write a canonical backlog file that the `self-improve` skill can consume.

**This skill is RIGID. Follow each step exactly.**

## Engineering principles all experts must apply

Every expert is bound by these rules (already embedded in their agent definitions):
1. **Evidence-based only** — no finding without a file:line citation
2. **Rust-first** — flag any TypeScript logic that belongs in Rust
3. **Zero bug policy** — every bug comes with a failing test outline

The synthesis must reflect these principles: bugs are Priority 1 regardless of severity perception, Rust migration candidates get their own section, and every item in the plan must have code-level evidence.

---

## Step 1 — Gather context (do this BEFORE spawning agents)

Run these in parallel:

```bash
# GitHub issues
gh issue list --limit 30 --json number,title,body,labels,state 2>/dev/null || echo "No GitHub issues available"

# Recent commits (last 2 weeks of work)
git --no-pager log --since="2 weeks ago" --pretty=format:"%h %s" | head -30

# Current HEAD SHA (for cache freshness)
git rev-parse HEAD

# Current file counts by area
find src/ -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -v __tests__ | grep -v ".test." | wc -l
find src-tauri/src/ -name "*.rs" | wc -l
```

Also read `.claude/self-improve-log.md` if it exists. Extract already-attempted task IDs and their statuses. You will mark these in the backlog so self-improve doesn't retry them.

Save the output — you'll include it in every agent prompt.

---

## Step 2 — Spawn all 6 experts IN PARALLEL (single message, 6 Agent calls)

Send all 6 Agent tool calls in the same message. Each agent already knows what files to read and what to look for — their agent definitions contain domain knowledge.

Provide each agent with the **context from Step 1** (git log, GitHub issues, HEAD SHA). Do NOT tell agents which files to read — they know their domain.

### Agent 1: Product Improvement Expert
```
subagent_type: product-improvement-expert
prompt: "Review the mdownreview codebase for product improvement opportunities. Produce your Product Improvement Report.

Context from recent work:
[INSERT GIT LOG OUTPUT]

Open GitHub issues:
[INSERT GH ISSUES OUTPUT OR "none"]"
```

### Agent 2: Performance Expert
```
subagent_type: performance-expert
prompt: "Review the mdownreview codebase for performance issues. Produce your Performance Analysis Report.

Context from recent work:
[INSERT GIT LOG OUTPUT]"
```

### Agent 3: Architect Expert
```
subagent_type: architect-expert
prompt: "Review the mdownreview architecture. Produce your Architecture Review.

Context from recent work:
[INSERT GIT LOG OUTPUT]"
```

### Agent 4: React + Tauri Expert
```
subagent_type: react-tauri-expert
prompt: "Review mdownreview for React and Tauri API usage issues. Produce your React + Tauri Expert Review.

Context from recent work:
[INSERT GIT LOG OUTPUT]"
```

### Agent 5: UX Expert
```
subagent_type: ux-expert
prompt: "Review mdownreview's user experience. Produce your UX Review.

Context from recent work:
[INSERT GIT LOG OUTPUT]

Open GitHub issues:
[INSERT GH ISSUES OUTPUT OR "none"]"
```

### Agent 6: Bug Hunter
```
subagent_type: bug-hunter
prompt: "Hunt for bugs in the mdownreview codebase. Produce your Bug Hunt Report.

Context from recent work:
[INSERT GIT LOG OUTPUT]"
```

---

## Step 3 — Wait for all 6 agents to complete

Do not proceed until all 6 have returned results.

---

## Step 4 — Cross-reference with GitHub issues

For each open GitHub issue, check which expert's findings address it. Note any issues that no expert found a root cause for — these need manual investigation.

---

## Step 5 — Synthesize the Improvement Plan

Write a consolidated **report for the user** structured as:

```markdown
# mdownreview Improvement Plan
Generated: [date]

## Engineering Principles Applied
This review enforces:
- Evidence-based: every item has a file:line citation
- Rust-first: TypeScript→Rust migration candidates collected
- Zero bug policy: all confirmed bugs are Priority 1 with test outlines

## Executive Summary
[3-4 sentences covering the overall health of the app and top themes]

## GitHub Issues Status
| # | Title | Expert Findings | Status |
|---|-------|-----------------|--------|
| [num] | [title] | [which expert addressed it and how] | Addressed / Needs investigation |

## Priority 1 — Bugs (fix before anything else)
### [Bug title]
- **Found by**: [expert name(s)]
- **Location**: [file:line]
- **Evidence**: [quote or description of the defect code]
- **Failing test outline**:
  ```typescript/rust
  // test that would catch this
  ```
- **Fix**: [specific recommendation]
- **Rust-first?**: [yes — propose Rust command / no — fix in place]

## Priority 2 — Improve Soon (friction and design issues)
### [Issue title]
- **Found by**: [expert name(s)]
- **Location**: [file:line]
- **Evidence**: [code citation]
- **Fix**: [specific recommendation]

## Priority 3 — Invest In (features and architecture)
[Same format — evidence required for inclusion]

## Rust-First Migration Candidates
| Item | Current Location | Proposed Rust Command | Benefit |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|---------|
| [computation] | [file:line] | `pub fn ...() -> Result<T, String>` | [perf/reliability gain] |

## Quick Wins (< 1 hour each, high value, evidence-based)
1. [Action] — [file:line] — [expected improvement] — [test needed: yes/no]

## Expert Consensus (issues flagged by 2+ experts)
[List items multiple experts independently flagged — highest-confidence issues]

## Recommended Sprint Plan
**This week (bugs first)**: [3-5 specific tasks with file:line references]
**Next sprint**: [themes / larger investments]
**Backlog**: [things to keep an eye on]
```

Show the full report to the user. Do not truncate it.

---

## Step 6 — Write the self-improve backlog cache

After showing the report, write `.claude/self-improve-cache.md` with the canonical backlog that the `self-improve` skill consumes. This file is the **single source of truth** for automated improvements.

### Task ID format

Use **stable, content-derived IDs** so IDs survive across review runs without renumbering:
- Format: `[type]-[slug]` where slug is 2-4 hyphenated words from the task
- Examples: `bug-unlisten-cleanup`, `rust-levenshtein-migration`, `feat-keyboard-nav`
- IDs must be deterministic: the same finding should produce the same ID across runs

### Cache file format

```markdown
---
generated_at: [ISO 8601 datetime]
head_sha: [full HEAD SHA from Step 1]
branch: [current branch name]
---

# Expert Review Backlog

## Summary Table

| ID | Task | Priority | Type | Quick Win | Expert | Files | Risk | Has Test Outline | Status |
|----|------|----------|------|-----------|--------|-------|------|------------------|--------|
| bug-unlisten-cleanup | Fix missing unlisten in useFileWatcher | P1 | bug | yes | bug-hunter | src/hooks/useFileWatcher.ts | low | yes | open |
| rust-levenshtein | Move Levenshtein to Rust command | P2 | rust-migration | yes | performance | src/lib/comment-matching.ts | low | no | open |
| feat-keyboard-nav | Add keyboard nav to CommentsPanel | P3 | feature | yes | ux | src/components/comments/CommentsPanel.tsx | low | no | open |
...

<!-- Status values: open, done, failed, skipped -->
<!-- Tasks from self-improve-log.md are pre-marked as done/failed/skipped -->

---

## Task Details

### bug-unlisten-cleanup
- **Priority**: P1
- **Type**: bug
- **Quick win**: yes
- **Risk**: low
- **Found by**: bug-hunter
- **Location**: src/hooks/useFileWatcher.ts:42
- **Evidence**: useEffect cleanup function does not call unlisten() for the file-changed listener, causing listener leak on unmount
- **Fix**: Store the unlisten promise returned by listen() and call it in the useEffect cleanup
- **Rust-first**: no
- **Failing test outline**:
```typescript
it('should unlisten on unmount', () => {
  const { unmount } = renderHook(() => useFileWatcher());
  unmount();
  expect(mockUnlisten).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### rust-levenshtein
- **Priority**: P2
- **Type**: rust-migration
- **Quick win**: yes
- **Risk**: low
- **Found by**: performance
- **Location**: src/lib/comment-matching.ts:80-138
- **Evidence**: Levenshtein distance (O(m×n) per pair) runs in React render path via useMemo. For files with many comments and large content, this blocks the main thread.
- **Fix**: Move to a Rust Tauri command: `pub fn fuzzy_match_comments(content: &str, comments: Vec<CommentAnchor>) -> Vec<MatchResult>`
- **Rust-first**: yes — proposed command signature above

### feat-keyboard-nav
...

<!-- Continue for ALL tasks. Every row in the Summary Table MUST have a matching detail block. -->
```

### Rules for writing the cache

1. **Every finding from the synthesis becomes a task** with a detail block — not just quick wins
2. **Pre-mark status** for tasks that appear in `.claude/self-improve-log.md` (done/failed/skipped)
3. **Do not remove** previously-done tasks — keep them with their status for continuity
4. **One canonical record per finding** — a task has one priority, one type, and a quick_win flag. Do not duplicate across sections.
5. **Preserve IDs from prior cache** — if `.claude/self-improve-cache.md` already exists and a finding maps to an existing ID, reuse that ID

---

## Step 7 — Create or update GitHub issues for Priority 1 bugs (optional)

If GitHub CLI (`gh`) is available and authenticated, create or update issues for P1 bugs:

1. For each P1 task, search for an existing open issue with the task ID in the title or body:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --search "[task-id]" --json number,title,state --limit 5
   ```
2. **If no matching open issue exists**: create one:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "Bug: [task title]" --body "[evidence, location, test outline, task ID: [id]]" --label "bug,auto-review"
   ```
3. **If a matching open issue exists**: skip (do not create duplicates)
4. **If `gh` is not available or not authenticated**: skip this step entirely — it is not required for the backlog to be valid

Print which issues were created/skipped.
