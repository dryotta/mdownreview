name: optimize-prompt
description: Use when authoring or editing a skill (SKILL.md), subagent definition, slash command, system prompt, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md instruction block, or any reusable prompt the user is about to save. Trigger on phrases like "create/update skill", "write/edit agent", "tweak this prompt", "tighten this", or whenever the user pastes prompt-shaped text and asks for review. Rewrites for clarity, triggering accuracy, and token efficiency without losing intent.

# optimize-prompt

Tighten prompts so the model triggers them at the right time, follows them under pressure, and burns minimal tokens doing so.

## When this applies

Any reusable text-to-model artifact:
- Skill `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + body)
- Subagent definitions (`.claude/agents/*.md`)
- Slash commands, hook prompts
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` sections
- Long user prompts the user wants to save or reuse

If the artifact is a one-shot question, skip — this is for prompts that will run repeatedly.

## Workflow

1. Read the artifact and identify its kind (skill / agent / instruction block / freeform).
2. Diagnose against the rules below. Note each issue with the rule it violates.
3. Rewrite. Keep the author's voice and any domain specifics.
4. Show a concise diff: bullet list of what changed and why, then the rewritten text in a fenced block. End with token deltas (`wc -w` before/after) so the user sees the win.
5. Stop. Do not also implement features the prompt describes — this skill optimizes the prompt itself.

## Rules

### Description / triggering (skills + agents)

- **Description states WHEN, not WHAT.** A description that summarizes the workflow makes the model shortcut to the description and skip the body. Lead with "Use when…" and list concrete triggers, symptoms, file types, or user phrases. ([writing-skills CSO](../../plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/superpowers/5.0.7/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md))
- **Be specific and slightly pushy.** Models under-trigger skills. Name the situations explicitly ("even if the user doesn't say 'X' directly").
- **Third person, imperative.** "Use when implementing…" not "I help you implement…".
- **Keep frontmatter under ~1024 chars**, name uses `[a-z0-9-]` only.

### Body

- **Imperative mood, short sentences.** "Read the file. Identify X. Rewrite." beats "You should probably consider reading…".
- **Explain the WHY for non-obvious rules.** A one-line rationale lets the model reason about edge cases instead of pattern-matching. Skip rationale for trivially obvious rules.
- **Avoid shouty `MUST`/`NEVER`/`ALWAYS` unless the rule is genuinely non-negotiable.** Overuse trains the model to ignore them. Reserve for hard invariants (security, data loss, irreversible ops).
- **One excellent example beats three mediocre ones.** Cut redundant examples that demonstrate the same pattern.
- **Push heavy reference material out.** API tables, long schemas, large code samples → a sibling file in `references/` or `assets/`, linked from the body. Keeps the always-loaded surface small.
- **Cross-reference, don't duplicate.** If another skill already covers it, link by name (`superpowers:test-driven-development`) — do not restate.
- **Tables > prose for lookup data.** Prose > tables for reasoning.
- **Aim for <200 lines** for the body; <500 is the hard ceiling. Frequently-loaded skills should be <200 words total.

### Token-efficiency edits (apply on every pass)

- Cut hedges: "please", "kindly", "if possible", "feel free to", "I think", "perhaps", "just", "really".
- Cut self-reference: "this skill will…", "in this document we…". The model knows where it is.
- Cut throat-clearing: "It is important to note that…", "Keep in mind that…" — state the rule directly.
- Collapse synonyms: "clear, concise, and brief" → "concise".
- Replace narrative with structure: bullets, tables, fenced code, numbered steps.
- Strip emoji unless the user asked for them.
- Remove dated commentary ("recently we found…", "as of 2024…") unless the date matters.

### Anti-patterns to flag

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| Description summarizes workflow | Move workflow to body; keep description = triggers only |
| Body restates what the description says | Delete the duplication |
| Wall of `MUST` / `NEVER` | Demote to plain imperative; keep caps for true invariants |
| Multi-language examples (JS + Py + Go) | Pick one language; the model can port |
| Narrative ("last week we tried…") | Convert to a rule + one-line rationale |
| Unbounded reference material inline | Move to `references/<topic>.md`, link with one-line summary |
| Vague triggers ("for async stuff") | Replace with concrete symptoms / file types / user phrases |

## Output format

Reply with three sections in this order:

```
## Changes
- <bullet>: <why>
- <bullet>: <why>

## Optimized
<fenced block with the rewritten artifact, full file contents>

## Token delta
before: <N words> · after: <M words> · saved: <N-M> (<pct>%)
```

If the artifact is already lean, say so plainly and skip the rewrite — do not invent changes to look productive.

## Example

**Input** (excerpt from a skill description):

> This is an extremely powerful skill that helps you with reviewing pull requests by carefully analyzing the diff and providing comments. You should ALWAYS use this whenever you're doing a PR review, and you MUST follow every step.

**Optimized:**

> Use when reviewing a pull request, GitHub diff, or `gh pr view` output, or when the user asks for code review on a branch.

Why: removed self-praise ("extremely powerful"), removed workflow summary ("analyzing the diff and providing comments" — that goes in the body), dropped shouty `ALWAYS`/`MUST`, replaced with concrete triggers (`gh pr view`, "branch"). 38 words → 24 words.

## When not to rewrite

- The artifact is already under target length and reads cleanly. Say so.
- The user wants stylistic feedback only, not a rewrite. Give bullets, not a new draft.
- The "prompt" is actually code, config, or documentation prose for humans. Decline and explain.
