name: iterate
description: Autonomous iteration loop on a single branch and single PR. Accepts a GitHub issue number (or #N / issue-N / issue URL) for issue mode, no-args to auto-pick the oldest groomed issue, or free text for goal mode. Runs up to 30 rebase → assess → plan → implement → validate → 6-expert review iterations, forward-fixing all failures. On success, validates via Release Gate before marking the PR ready. Supersedes implement-issue, self-improve-loop, and start-feature.

# Iterate

Runs **one** autonomous iteration loop against **one branch and one PR** until the goal is achieved, the iteration cap is hit, or a terminal block is reached:
pre-flight → branch → draft PR → for each iteration { rebase → assess → pre-consult → plan → implement → validate (push + CI + local, forward-fix) → expert review → record } → on Done-Achieved, release-gate validation → mark PR ready.

**Fully autonomous after the skill starts — no user interaction.**

**RIGID. Follow every step exactly.**

## Product charter (governs every iteration)

Every change must respect the product charter. Before editing a domain, skim the relevant deep-dive:

- **Charter (always):** [`docs/principles.md`](../../../docs/principles.md) — 5 pillars (Professional, Reliable, Performant, Lean, Architecturally Sound) + 3 meta-principles (Rust-First with MVVM, Never Increase Engineering Debt, Zero Bug Policy).
- [`docs/architecture.md`](../../../docs/architecture.md) — IPC/logger chokepoints, Zustand boundaries, file-size budgets.
- [`docs/performance.md`](../../../docs/performance.md) — numeric budgets, watcher rules, render-cost rules.
- [`docs/security.md`](../../../docs/security.md) — IPC surface, CSP, atomic writes, path canonicalization.
- [`docs/design-patterns.md`](../../../docs/design-patterns.md) — React 19 + Tauri v2 idioms.
- [`docs/test-strategy.md`](../../../docs/test-strategy.md) — three-layer pyramid, coverage floors, mock hygiene.

The assessor, the pre-consult experts, and the 6-expert diff review all cite specific rule numbers. An iteration that violates a rule from a deep-dive is blocked at review even if all tests are green.

## Input

One optional argument. The skill detects mode deterministically:

| Argument | Mode |
|---|---|
| (empty) | Issue mode — auto-pick oldest open `groomed` issue |
| `42` | Issue mode, issue #42 |
| `#42` | Issue mode, issue #42 |
| `issue-42` (case-insensitive) | Issue mode, issue #42 |
| `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/42[…]` | Issue mode, issue #42 |
| anything else | Goal mode, argument used verbatim as the goal text (outer quotes stripped) |

---

## Phase 0 — Setup (runs once per invocation)

### 0a. Parse the argument and decide mode

Let `ARG` be the entire string after the skill name, trimmed.

Apply these rules in order; the first match wins:

1. `ARG` empty → `MODE=issue`, auto-pick (see 0c).
2. `ARG` matches `^\d+$` → `MODE=issue`, `ISSUE_NUMBER=$ARG`.
3. `ARG` matches `^#(\d+)$` → `MODE=issue`, `ISSUE_NUMBER=<group 1>`.
4. `ARG` matches `^[Ii]ssue-(\d+)$` → `MODE=issue`, `ISSUE_NUMBER=<group 1>`.
5. `ARG` matches `^https?://github\.com/[^/]+/[^/]+/issues/(\d+)([/#?].*)?$` → `MODE=issue`, `ISSUE_NUMBER=<group 1>`.
6. Otherwise → `MODE=goal`, `GOAL_TEXT=<ARG with surrounding quotes stripped>`.

### 0b. Pre-flight (parallel)

Run in parallel:
```bash
git status --porcelain
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
```

- **Dirty working tree** → STOP: `[iterate] Working tree is dirty. Commit or stash changes first.`
- **Not on `main`** → `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only` (no halt).

### 0c. Issue-mode auto-pick (only when 0a rule 1 matched)

```bash
gh issue list --label "groomed" --state open --json number,title,body,labels --limit 100 \
  | jq 'sort_by(.number) | .[0]'
```

If nothing returned, STOP: `[iterate] No groomed issues found. Run /groom-issues first, or call /iterate with a goal.`
Otherwise, set `ISSUE_NUMBER=<number from JSON>`.

### 0d. Issue-mode-only: load the spec

```bash
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json number,title,body,labels,comments
```

Find the comment whose body begins with `<!-- mdownreview-spec -->` and capture its full body as `SPEC_MARKDOWN`. If no such comment, STOP:
`[iterate] #$ISSUE_NUMBER has no spec. Run /groom-issues $ISSUE_NUMBER first.`

Capture: `ISSUE_TITLE`, `ISSUE_BODY`, `SPEC_MARKDOWN`, `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA` (parsed `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checklist items from the spec).

### 0e. Compute branch, PR title, and goal-for-assessor

| Variable | Issue mode | Goal mode |
|---|---|---|
| `BRANCH` | `feature/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER-<3–5-word kebab slug of $ISSUE_TITLE>` | `auto-improve/<slug of $GOAL_TEXT, 40-char cap>-$(date +%Y%m%d)` |
| `PR_TITLE` | `feat: implement #$ISSUE_NUMBER — $ISSUE_TITLE` | `auto-improve: $GOAL_TEXT` |
| `GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR` | `Satisfy all acceptance criteria of #$ISSUE_NUMBER: $ISSUE_TITLE` | `$GOAL_TEXT` |
| `PR_CLOSE_TRAILER` | `Closes #$ISSUE_NUMBER` | (omit) |

Slug rules: lowercase, non-alphanumerics → `-`, collapse runs of `-`, trim leading/trailing `-`.

### 0f. Create branch and draft PR

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
```

If `$BRANCH` already exists (local OR remote), STOP:
`[iterate] Branch $BRANCH already exists. Delete it or pick a different invocation — resume is not supported.`
Do NOT delete it — a pre-existing branch may hold human work.

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(iterate): start — $GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR"
git push -u origin HEAD

# rerere caches conflict resolutions across future rebases
git config rerere.enabled true
git config rerere.autoupdate true
```

Build `PR_BODY`:
- Issue mode: header links to the issue, full `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA` checklist is pasted (unchecked initially; assessor ticks as it satisfies items), trailer line is `Closes #$ISSUE_NUMBER`.
- Goal mode: header quotes the goal text; empty progress list.

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "$PR_TITLE" --body "$PR_BODY"
```

Capture `PR_NUMBER` and `PR_URL` from the output.

### 0g. Initialise the state file

Write `.claude/iterate-state.md`:

```markdown
---
mode: <issue | goal>
goal: "<GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>"
issue_number: <ISSUE_NUMBER or null>
started_at: <ISO datetime>
branch: <BRANCH>
pr: <PR_URL>
pr_number: <PR_NUMBER>
iteration_cap: 30
---
# Iteration Log
```

### 0h. Print start banner

```
[iterate] Mode: <MODE> | Goal: <GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>
Branch: <BRANCH> | PR: <PR_URL>
Starting autonomous loop — cap 30 iterations. No further interaction needed.
```

---

## Phase 1 — Iteration loop

Track counters: `iteration=1`, `passed_count=0`, `degraded_count=0`. Execute Steps 1 → 8 each iteration. Termination can fire only at Step 1 (rebase abort) or Step 2 (assessor `achieved` / `blocked`) or end-of-iteration (cap reached); see §Termination.

---

### Step 1 — Rebase onto `origin/main`

Rebase BEFORE Step 2 so the assessor reads a tree that reflects current main.

```bash
git fetch origin main

if git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD; then
  echo "[sync] branch already contains origin/main — no rebase needed"
else
  git rebase --strategy=recursive --strategy-option=diff3 origin/main
fi
```

If the rebase completes cleanly (exit 0, working tree clean): skip to the "After successful rebase" block.

If the rebase pauses with conflicts, run the auto-resolution loop. Each loop iteration is one paused rebase commit. `rerere` auto-replays any conflict whose hunks were resolved before on this branch.

Counters:
```
attempt = 0                        # retries for the CURRENT paused commit
max_attempts_per_commit = 3
max_total_commits = 20
commits_replayed = 0
```

While a rebase is in progress (`.git/rebase-merge` or `.git/rebase-apply` exists):

1. **Detect state** (parallel):
   ```bash
   CONFLICTED=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U)
   HAS_MARKERS=$(git grep -lE '^<<<<<<< ' -- . 2>/dev/null || true)
   ```

2. **Empty-commit skip** — if `CONFLICTED` empty AND `HAS_MARKERS` empty (rerere fully resolved OR commit became empty after rebase):
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git -c core.editor=true rebase --continue 2>/dev/null || git rebase --skip
   ```
   `commits_replayed += 1`, `attempt = 0`. Continue loop.

3. **Auto-resolve in parallel** — one `task-implementer` per conflicted file, dispatched in ONE message:
   ```
   Resolve merge conflicts in <FILE> from rebasing the iterate branch onto main.

   Context:
   - Goal: <GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>
   - Iteration: <N> | Attempt: <attempt+1>/<max_attempts_per_commit>
   - Conflict markers use diff3: <<< ours === ||||||| base === >>> theirs
     * ours = iterate-branch work
     * base = common ancestor
     * theirs = incoming main
   - git rerere is enabled — your resolution will be cached and auto-replayed on future rebases. Prefer consistent, principled resolutions over one-off hacks.

   Rules:
   - Preserve the intent of BOTH sides. If main refactored/renamed/moved code that ours also touched, adapt ours to main's new shape — do NOT revert main.
   - Remove ALL conflict markers.
   - Do NOT run `git add` or `git rebase --continue`. Just write the resolved file.
   - If the conflict is semantically impossible (e.g. main deleted a feature ours extended), state so explicitly and leave the markers in place — the loop will escalate.

   Return: file path, one-paragraph resolution summary, confidence 0–100.
   ```

4. **Stage and continue**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git -c core.editor=true rebase --continue
   RC=$?
   ```

5. **Outcome**:
   - `RC=0` and rebase still in progress → `commits_replayed += 1`, `attempt = 0`. Continue loop.
   - `RC=0` and rebase complete → break out of loop.
   - `RC≠0` (still conflicts on same commit):
     - `attempt += 1`
     - If `attempt < max_attempts_per_commit`: re-run step 3 with an augmented prompt that includes the prior attempt's resolution and the still-present markers.
     - If `attempt == max_attempts_per_commit`: escalate ONCE — spawn `architect-expert` with the full file contents, the diff from main, the diff from ours, and all prior implementer summaries. Apply its output, re-run step 4.
     - If still conflicting after the architect escalation, OR if `commits_replayed > max_total_commits`: go to Abort.

6. **Abort** (all auto-resolution failed):
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```
   Append to state file:
   ```markdown
   ## Iteration <N> — BLOCKED (merge conflict)
   - Conflicted commit: <current HEAD of paused rebase>
   - Files: <list>
   - Attempts: <implementer retries + 1 architect>
   - Summary: <text>
   ```
   Jump to **Done-Blocked** with reason = `merge conflict against main at iteration <N> — human resolution required`.

**After a successful rebase**, sync the remote and capture the iteration baseline:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
ITER_BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

`ITER_BASE_SHA` bounds Step 6's review diff to THIS iteration's NEW work.

**Post-rebase sanity gate** (catches subtle resolution errors before the full suite):
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
(cd src-tauri && cargo check)
```

If either fails, spawn `task-implementer` with the compile/type errors and instruction to fix as a follow-up commit. Commit + push. Only proceed to Step 2 once the tree compiles.

---

### Step 2 — Assess

Spawn `goal-assessor` in ONE call. Inputs:

```
Goal: <GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>
Iteration: <N>/30
Passed so far: <passed_count>
Degraded so far: <degraded_count>
Iteration log (prior): <full content of .claude/iterate-state.md>

<Issue mode only — append this block:>
Issue #<ISSUE_NUMBER>: <ISSUE_TITLE>
Issue body:
<ISSUE_BODY>

Spec (source of truth — the contract with the human reviewer):
<SPEC_MARKDOWN>

Acceptance criteria (remaining open items — the skill has been ticking these off in the PR body as iterations satisfy them; derive current state from the iteration log):
<open AC bullets>
<End issue-mode block.>

Instruction:
Read the codebase from scratch. Ignore prior iteration specs. Assess whether the goal is fully achieved and, if not, write requirement specs for the next meaningful sprint — a coherent body of work that delivers visible progress, not just the smallest next step. Group requirements by what can be implemented in parallel.

In issue mode: for each remaining AC checkbox, determine whether it is currently satisfied by the code and say so with file:line evidence. If NEXT_REQUIREMENTS is empty but some AC is still open, mark STATUS=blocked with BLOCKING_REASON pointing at the unreachable AC.
```

The agent returns:
```
STATUS: achieved | in_progress | blocked
CONFIDENCE: 0–100
NEXT_REQUIREMENTS: <bulleted spec, grouped for parallelism>
EVIDENCE: <file:line citations>
BLOCKING_REASON: <only when STATUS=blocked>
```

Routing:
- `achieved` → skip Steps 3–8, jump straight to **Done-Achieved**. No new commit this iteration.
- `blocked` → skip Steps 3–8, jump straight to **Done-Blocked**. No new commit.
- `in_progress` → continue to Step 3.

---

### Step 3 — Demand-driven pre-consult (parallel)

Scan `NEXT_REQUIREMENTS` text for domain triggers. For each triggered expert, spawn it **in one parallel message** alongside the others. If no trigger matches, skip Step 3 entirely.

| Trigger (keyword or path pattern in NEXT_REQUIREMENTS) | Expert |
|---|---|
| "IPC", "Tauri command", "invoke", `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`, `src/lib/tauri-commands.ts`, `src/store/*` | `architect-expert` |
| "React component", "hook", "Zustand", `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/store/` | `react-tauri-expert` |
| "file read", "file write", "path", "markdown render", `src-tauri/src/core/sidecar.rs`, `MarkdownViewer` | `security-reviewer` |
| "startup", "debounce", "throttle", "watcher", "large file", "render cost" | `performance-expert` |
| any source-code change (virtually always) | `test-expert` |
| change that might affect a `docs/features/` area OR modifies `AGENTS.md`/`BUILDING.md`/`docs/**/*.md` | `documentation-expert` |
| new dependency in `package.json`/`Cargo.toml`, large new module, significant net-new LOC, or file that might breach a budget in `docs/architecture.md` | `lean-expert` |

Each expert prompt:

```
I'm about to plan iteration <N> for <MODE> <ref>.

Goal: <GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>
Next requirements (assessor output):
<NEXT_REQUIREMENTS>
Evidence:
<EVIDENCE>

From your area of expertise:
1. Key considerations for this iteration.
2. Risks or pitfalls to watch for.
3. Which files to modify and how.

Cite file:line for every recommendation. Cite rule numbers from docs/*.md when a rule applies. If the plan looks sound, say so in one line.
```

Collect any guidance into a short `ADVISORY_SUMMARY`. If no expert was spawned, `ADVISORY_SUMMARY = "none — no expert domains triggered"`.

---

### Step 4 — Plan

Spawn `general-purpose`:

```
Produce a comprehensive sprint plan for this iteration. Identify ALL changes needed to make the requested progress — do not artificially limit scope.

Goal: <GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>
Iteration: <N>/30
Mode: <MODE>
<Issue mode only:>
Spec excerpt (the contract):
<relevant sections of SPEC_MARKDOWN>
Remaining acceptance criteria:
<open AC bullets>
<End.>
Next requirements (assessor):
<NEXT_REQUIREMENTS>
Expert guidance:
<ADVISORY_SUMMARY>

Use the grouping in NEXT_REQUIREMENTS to organise the plan: independent groups run in parallel, dependent groups wait for their dependencies.

For each group:
- Files to change · exact changes · tests to write · dependencies on other groups
- Local validation expected to pass
- Acceptance-criteria items satisfied (issue mode only — cite spec text)

Rate overall risk: low | medium | high.

Non-negotiable completeness rules:
- Every UI-visible behaviour change: browser e2e test in e2e/browser/ AND native e2e test in e2e/native/ if the scenario requires real file I/O or IPC (docs/test-strategy.md rules 4-5)
- Every new Tauri command: update commands.rs + tauri-commands.ts + IPC mock in src/__mocks__/@tauri-apps/api/core.ts (docs/test-strategy.md rule 5)
- Delete code made obsolete by this change in the same step
- No TODO comments, no half-wired code, no workarounds

Charter meta-principles (non-negotiable):
- Rust-First with MVVM: Model = Rust (src-tauri/src/core/, commands.rs); ViewModel = src/lib/vm/ + src/hooks/ + src/store/; View = src/components/
- Never Increase Engineering Debt: every iteration reduces or holds debt flat; close Gap markers in deep-dive docs where applicable
- Zero Bug Policy: every fix ships with a regression test reproducing the original failure
```

Save the plan text as `PLAN`. Parse each group; label them `independent` or with their dependencies.

**If `risk=high`**: spawn `architect-expert`:
```
Identify the specific risks in this plan and propose concrete mitigations so it can proceed safely.
<Paste full PLAN here.>
```
Incorporate mitigations into a revised `PLAN` and continue. If the architect judges the approach fundamentally unsound, log `SKIPPED — architect rejected: <reason>` to the state file, go to Step 8 (skip 5–7), then advance iteration.

---

### Step 5 — Implement (parallel by plan group)

For each **independent group** in `PLAN`, spawn ONE `task-implementer`. Send ALL independent groups in one parallel message. Dependent groups wait for their dependency waves.

Each `task-implementer` prompt:

```
Implement this group of changes for mdownreview.

<Mode-specific header:>
Issue: #<ISSUE_NUMBER> — <ISSUE_TITLE>
OR
Goal: <GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>
<End.>

Iteration: <N>/30
Group: <group name and dependency note>
Files: <file list for this group>
Changes: <exact changes from PLAN>
Tests: <tests to write — unit + e2e if UI-visible>
Context: <relevant spec/goal excerpt>

Do NOT touch files outside this group. Do NOT ask clarifying questions — if ambiguous, make the conservative choice and note it.
Return Implementation Summary: files modified · tests written · decisions made · concerns.
```

Wait for each dependency wave before spawning the next. Collect every Implementation Summary.

If every implementer in this iteration reports "no changes made or needed": log `SKIPPED — no-op: <reason>` to the state file, do NOT commit or push, advance iteration.

---

### Step 6 — Push + race validate

#### 6a. Push immediately

```bash
git add <specific files reported by implementers — never git add -A blindly>
git commit -m "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"
git push
```

Commit message (see §Commit conventions for the full table):
- Issue mode: `feat(#<N>): iter <iteration> — <one-line summary>` with a 2-3 sentence body and `Refs #<N>` trailer.
- Goal mode: `auto-improve: iter <iteration> — <one-line summary>` with a 2-3 sentence body.
Both include `Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

#### 6b. Local validation and CI poll (parallel)

Spawn both in ONE message:

**Agent A** — `implementation-validator`:
```
Run the full local test suite in order:
1. npm run lint
2. npx tsc --noEmit
3. cd src-tauri && cargo test
4. npm test
5. npm run test:e2e
6. npm run test:e2e:native

Return PASS or FAIL with full output for every check.
```

**Agent B** — `general-purpose` (CI poller):
```
Poll CI status for PR <PR_NUMBER> every 30 seconds until all checks complete or 30 minutes elapse.
  gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>
Stop when no check shows "pending" or "in_progress".
Return: PASS (all checks green) or FAIL (list of failed check names with their logs).
```

Wait for both.

#### 6c. Forward-fix loop (max 5 attempts)

Repeat until both PASS or 5 attempts exhausted:

1. Spawn `task-implementer`:
   ```
   Fix the following failures. Do not revert — make a forward fix.
   Local failures: <full local output>
   CI failures: <failed check names and logs>
   Prior attempts in this loop: <summaries>

   Make the minimal change needed to resolve each failure. Prefer tightening existing code over adding new abstractions.
   Return Implementation Summary.
   ```
2. Commit + push:
   ```bash
   git add <specific files>
   git commit -m "fix(iter-<iteration>): <one-line summary>"
   git push
   ```
3. Re-run 6b (local + CI in parallel).
4. If both PASS: break, proceed to Step 7.
5. If still failing after attempt 5: log `DEGRADED — could not fix validate/CI after 5 attempts: <summary>`. Do NOT revert commits — leave them for the next iteration's assessor. `degraded_count += 1`. Proceed to Step 7 anyway (expert review still runs).

---

### Step 7 — Expert diff review

Capture only THIS iteration's NEW diff:

```bash
git diff $ITER_BASE_SHA HEAD --stat
git diff $ITER_BASE_SHA HEAD
```

Spawn the **9-expert panel** in ONE parallel message:

- `product-improvement-expert`
- `performance-expert`
- `architect-expert`
- `react-tauri-expert`
- `ux-expert`
- `bug-hunter`
- `test-expert`
- `documentation-expert`
- `lean-expert`

**Conditional expert** — include in the same parallel message when the diff matches:

| Condition (match ANY) | Also spawn |
|---|---|
| Diff touches `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`, `src-tauri/src/core/sidecar.rs`, any `Path`/`canonicalize` usage, or any markdown-rendering code under `src/components/viewers/` | `security-reviewer` |

Each expert prompt:

```
Review this iteration's diff for mdownreview.

<Mode-specific header:>
Issue: #<ISSUE_NUMBER> — <ISSUE_TITLE>
OR
Goal: <GOAL_FOR_ASSESSOR>
<End.>

Iteration: <N>/30
Spec/goal context:
<relevant excerpt>

Diff stat:
<output of git diff --stat>

Full diff:
<output of git diff>

BLOCK on any of these — APPROVE otherwise. Cite specific rule numbers from docs/*.md when blocking.

1. Does this make progress toward the goal / acceptance criterion it claims?
2. New bugs, regressions, or architectural problems? (docs/architecture.md rules)
3. Violates any rule in docs/performance.md, docs/security.md, docs/design-patterns.md, or docs/test-strategy.md?
4. UI-visible change without a browser e2e test in e2e/browser/? (docs/test-strategy.md rules 4-5)
5. Dead code, unused imports, replaced patterns not deleted in the same iteration?
6. Technical debt — TODO comments, half-wired code, bypassed checks, workarounds?
7. Rust-First with MVVM respected? (docs/principles.md, docs/architecture.md rules 1-10)

Return: APPROVE or BLOCK with file:line evidence AND "violates rule N in docs/X.md" citation for every BLOCK.
```

Wait for ALL experts.

**If any BLOCK**: spawn `task-implementer` with the union of blocking issues:

```
Fix the following blocking review issues. Do not revert — forward fix.
<For each blocking issue: expert name, file:line, rule citation, fix direction>

Make the minimal change that satisfies each blocker. Do NOT reopen approved concerns.
Return Implementation Summary.
```

Commit + push (`fix(iter-<iteration>): <summary>`), then re-run Step 6b (local validation + CI poll). Then re-run the SAME expert panel on the updated iteration diff (re-capture `git diff $ITER_BASE_SHA HEAD`).

If experts still BLOCK after ONE fix round: log `DEGRADED — expert review: <issue summaries>`. `degraded_count += 1`. Do NOT revert. Proceed to Step 8.

---

### Step 8 — Record iteration

Append to `.claude/iterate-state.md`:

```markdown
## Iteration <N> — <PASSED | DEGRADED | SKIPPED>
- Commits: <list of SHAs from ITER_BASE_SHA to HEAD>
- Validate+CI: <passed | fixed in K attempts | degraded after 5>
- Expert review: <A approved / B blocked — list>
- Goal assessor confidence: <%>
- Summary: <one sentence>
<if DEGRADED:>
- Carry-over issues: <bullet list — read by next iteration's assessor>
```

**Update PR body and progress**:

- Refresh the PR body's progress list:
  - Issue mode: tick any AC checkbox that this iteration's assessor confirmed or this iteration's implementers clearly satisfied (cross-reference their Implementation Summaries).
  - Goal mode: append the iteration's completed requirement groups as ticked items.
  - Use `gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --body "<updated body>"`.

- Post a progress comment:
  ```bash
  gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
  <!-- iterate-iter-<N> -->
  ### <✅ PASSED | ⚠️ DEGRADED | ⏭️ SKIPPED> Iteration <N>/30

  **Commits:** <short SHAs>
  **Files changed:** <count>
  **Tests added/updated:** <count>
  <Issue mode: **AC satisfied this iteration:** <bullet list>>
  <Goal mode: **Requirements completed:** <bullet list>>
  <If DEGRADED: **Carry-over:** <summary>>

  Next: iteration <N+1> (assessor will re-scan on rebase)
  EOF
  )"
  ```

`iteration += 1`. If `PASSED`, `passed_count += 1`.

**Termination check** (after 8):
- If `iteration > 30`: go to **Done-TimedOut**.
- Otherwise: return to Step 1 of the next iteration.

---

### Step 9 — Release-gate validation (FINAL step — runs ONLY on Done-Achieved path)

Triggered from **Done-Achieved** before the iterate PR is marked ready. Purpose: run the full Windows + macOS **Release Gate** workflow (real installers, signed builds, platform matrix) against the accumulated work. Release Gate only triggers on PRs whose branch starts with `release/`, so this step creates a companion mirror branch+PR at the iterate branch tip, validates there, and forward-fixes any failures on the **iterate branch** (not the mirror) so humans review a single PR.

#### 9a. Create release-validation branch and mirror PR

```bash
RELEASE_BRANCH="release/iterate-$(echo "$BRANCH" | sed 's|^[^/]*/||' | cut -c1-40)-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)"
git checkout -b "$RELEASE_BRANCH"
git push -u origin HEAD
git checkout "$BRANCH"

RELEASE_PR_URL=$(gh pr create --draft --base main --head "$RELEASE_BRANCH" \
  --title "validate-release: $PR_TITLE" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Release-gate validation for #<PR_NUMBER>. Close with `gh pr close --delete-branch` after validation completes.
EOF
)")
RELEASE_PR_NUMBER=<parse the number from $RELEASE_PR_URL>
```

If `$RELEASE_BRANCH` already exists (e.g., a previous skill run crashed mid-step-9), halt as **Done-Blocked** with reason = `release-gate branch <RELEASE_BRANCH> already exists — delete it and re-run step 9 manually`. Do NOT overwrite.

Comment on the iterate PR:
```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "<!-- iterate-release-gate-start -->
⏳ Release-gate validation started on $RELEASE_PR_URL"
```

#### 9b. Poll CI + Release Gate on the mirror PR

Spawn `general-purpose`:
```
Poll CI and Release Gate status for PR <RELEASE_PR_NUMBER> every 60 seconds until all checks complete or 60 minutes elapse.
  gh pr checks <RELEASE_PR_NUMBER>
Stop when no check shows "pending" or "in_progress".
Return: PASS (all checks green) or FAIL (list of failed check names with their logs).
```

Release-gate jobs are slower than CI — use 60 min timeout (not 30) and 60 s poll interval (not 30).

#### 9c. Forward-fix loop (max 5 attempts)

On FAIL:

1. Spawn `task-implementer`:
   ```
   Fix the following Release Gate failures. Do not revert — forward fix.
   Failed checks: <names>
   Logs:
   <truncated logs>
   Prior attempts in this loop: <summaries>

   Edit files on the iterate branch (current working tree). Do NOT edit the release-mirror branch. Return Implementation Summary.
   ```
2. Commit + push on the **iterate branch**:
   ```bash
   git add <specific files>
   git commit -m "fix(iter-release): <one-line summary>"
   git push
   ```
3. Fast-forward the mirror branch to the iterate tip, then push (re-triggers Release Gate):
   ```bash
   git checkout "$RELEASE_BRANCH"
   git merge --ff-only "$BRANCH"
   git push
   git checkout "$BRANCH"
   ```
4. Re-run 9b.
5. PASS → proceed to 9d.
6. Still FAIL after attempt 5: halt as **Done-Blocked** with reason = `release-gate failure after 5 forward-fix attempts`. Leave mirror PR draft. Leave iterate PR draft.

#### 9d. Close the mirror PR and mark the iterate PR ready

Execute ALL of the following in order — this block IS the success path:

1. **Close the mirror PR and delete its branch:**
   ```bash
   gh pr close "$RELEASE_PR_NUMBER" --delete-branch
   ```

2. **Refresh the iterate PR body** — tick every progress item, change the summary to "Ready for review — goal achieved, release gate passed". In issue mode, ensure `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>` remains in the body trailer.
   ```bash
   gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --body "<final body>"
   ```

3. **Mark the iterate PR ready for review** (this is the only place in the skill that flips the iterate PR out of draft):
   ```bash
   gh pr ready <PR_NUMBER>
   ```

4. **Append to state file:**
   ```markdown
   ## Release-gate validation — PASSED
   - Mirror PR: <RELEASE_PR_URL> (closed with --delete-branch)
   - Fix attempts: <N>
   - Commit validated: <iterate branch HEAD SHA>
   - Iterate PR: <PR_URL> (marked ready for review)
   ```

5. **Comment on the iterate PR** so the reviewer sees the release-gate result inline:
   ```bash
   gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "<!-- iterate-release-gate-done -->
   🟢 Release gate validated on commit <sha>. Mirror PR closed. PR marked ready for review."
   ```

Proceed to **Done-Achieved** — the remaining step is just the success banner.

## Termination

Three specific points inside an iteration can terminate the loop:

1. **Step 1 aborts** (all rebase auto-resolution failed) → **Done-Blocked** with reason = merge-conflict. Steps 2–9 skipped.
2. **Step 2 returns `STATUS=achieved`** → **Done-Achieved** (runs Step 9 first). Steps 3–8 skipped this iteration.
3. **Step 2 returns `STATUS=blocked`** → **Done-Blocked**. Steps 3–9 skipped.

After a completed iteration (end of Step 8), if `iteration + 1 > 30`, exit via **Done-TimedOut**.

`DEGRADED` and `SKIPPED` iterations do NOT terminate. They count against `degraded_count` and the loop continues — the next iteration's assessor re-reads the code and will fold the carry-over in, OR re-flag it as `blocked` if structurally unfixable.

### Done-Achieved

**Step 9 Release-gate validation runs FIRST.** If it halts, you are in Done-Blocked — do not continue here.

Step 9d (on success) has already closed the mirror PR, refreshed the iterate PR body, and marked the iterate PR ready for review. Nothing more to do here except announce the result.

Print:
```
✅ <MODE> — <ref>
   PR: <PR_URL> (ready for review, release gate passed)
   Branch: <BRANCH>
   Iterations: <passed_count> passed · <degraded_count> degraded
   Release-gate fix attempts: <K>
   Final assessor confidence: <%>
```

Exit.

### Done-Blocked

Leave PR in draft. Comment on the iterate PR:
```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<!-- iterate-blocked -->
## ⚠️ Autonomous iteration halted at iteration <N>/30

**Reason:** <BLOCKING_REASON or rebase-conflict summary or release-gate reason>
**Last assessor evidence:** <EVIDENCE, if any>
<If rebase-conflict:>
**Conflicted files:** <list>
<End.>

Iterations 1..<N-1> are complete and pushed. This iteration needs human attention. After resolving the blocker, restart with `/iterate <same args>` (the branch must first be deleted) or continue manually on this branch.
EOF
)"
```

In issue mode, post the same message on the issue (use `<!-- iterate-blocked-issue -->`).

Print:
```
❌ <MODE> — <ref>
   Halted at iteration <N>/30
   Reason: <short>
   PR (draft): <PR_URL>
   Branch: <BRANCH>
```

Exit.

### Done-TimedOut

Leave PR in draft. Comment on the iterate PR:
```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<!-- iterate-timeout -->
## ⏱ Iteration cap reached (30)

**Progress:** <passed_count> passed · <degraded_count> degraded
**Final assessor confidence:** <%>
**Last NEXT_REQUIREMENTS (work still open):**
<bulleted list>

Review the branch, then either merge what is ready, continue manually, or restart with `/iterate <args>` after adjusting scope.
EOF
)"
```

In issue mode, post the same message on the issue.

Print:
```
⏱  <MODE> — <ref>
   Cap reached after 30 iterations
   PR (draft, partial progress): <PR_URL>
   Branch: <BRANCH>
```

Exit.

## Halt semantics (summary)

The skill **halts the loop** only on:
- Step 2 returns `STATUS=blocked`
- Step 1 aborts after all auto-resolution strategies fail
- Iteration cap reached (30)
- Step 9 (Release Gate) fails after 5 forward-fix attempts
- Step 9 finds a pre-existing release-mirror branch

The skill **logs `DEGRADED` and continues** on:
- Validate/CI fails after 5 forward-fix attempts (Step 6)
- Expert review blocks after one forward-fix attempt (Step 7)

The skill **logs `SKIPPED` and continues** on:
- `risk=high` plan is rejected by `architect-expert` as fundamentally unsound (Step 4)
- Every implementer in an iteration reports "no-op" (Step 5)

The skill **halts before starting the loop** on:
- Dirty working tree at setup
- Pre-existing target branch
- Issue mode and issue has no `<!-- mdownreview-spec -->` comment
- Issue mode auto-pick finds no groomed issues

No other halts.

## Commit conventions

| Situation | Mode | Message |
|---|---|---|
| Iteration implementation commit | Issue | `feat(#<N>): iter <iteration> — <summary>\n\n<2-3 sentence body>\n\nRefs #<N>\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>` |
| Iteration implementation commit | Goal | `auto-improve: iter <iteration> — <summary>\n\n<2-3 sentence body>\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>` |
| Forward-fix commit inside an iteration | Either | `fix(iter-<iteration>): <summary>` |
| Rebase-repair commit | Either | `fix(rebase): <summary>` |
| Release-gate forward-fix | Either | `fix(iter-release): <summary>` |

There is no "final-iteration" commit. When Step 2 returns `achieved`, Steps 3–8 are skipped, so no new commit is produced. Issue closure on merge is driven by the `Closes #<N>` trailer in the PR body (set in Phase 0f), not by commit messages.

---

## Failure recovery

If the skill is interrupted mid-loop:

1. Read `.claude/iterate-state.md` for branch, PR, and last iteration.
2. Check out the loop branch: `git checkout <BRANCH>`.
3. If a rebase is in progress (`.git/rebase-merge` or `.git/rebase-apply` exists), complete or abort it before restarting.
4. Ensure rerere is enabled on the branch (idempotent):
   ```bash
   git config rerere.enabled true
   git config rerere.autoupdate true
   ```
5. Restart is NOT supported — the pre-flight check in Phase 0 halts on the existing branch. To resume the work itself, delete the in-flight branch and re-invoke `/iterate <same args>` — Step 1's rebase + Step 2's assessor will account for the already-committed work on the deleted branch's remote tip if it has been pushed.
