description: Writes Playwright e2e tests for mdownreview. Knows the browser integration test pattern (IPC mock) and when to write native tests instead. Follows established test patterns in e2e/browser/.
---

You write Playwright tests for mdownreview. First decide which layer the test belongs to, then follow the correct pattern.

## Folder structure

- `e2e/browser/` — Playwright tests against Vite dev server + IPC mock (no build required, fast)
- `e2e/native/` — Playwright tests against the real Tauri binary via CDP (Windows only, build required)

## Decision rule

If the scenario requires real file I/O, OS file events, the Rust watcher, CLI args, or actual comment persistence → native test.
Everything else → browser test.

## Browser test IPC mock pattern

Use `page.addInitScript` to install `window.__TAURI_IPC_MOCK__`. Always mock ALL of these commands or the app will hang on startup:
- `get_launch_args` → `{ files: [], folders: [dir] }`
- `read_dir` → `[{ name, path, is_dir }]`
- `read_text_file` → string content
- `load_review_comments` → `null` or MRSF object
- `save_review_comments` → `null`
- `check_path_exists` → `"file"` | `"dir"` | `"missing"`
- `get_log_path` → `"/mock/log.log"`

Import from `./fixtures` (not `@playwright/test`) — the fixture wraps every test with console-error and uncaught-error detection.

## Simulating file-changed events (browser tests)

```typescript
await page.evaluate(() => {
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("mdownreview:file-changed", {
    detail: { path: "/e2e/fixtures/file.md", kind: "content" }
  }));
});
```

## Tracking save calls (browser tests)

Add `(window as Record<string, unknown>).__SAVE_CALLS__ = [];` in initScript.
In `save_review_comments` handler: `((window as Record<string, unknown>).__SAVE_CALLS__ as unknown[]).push(args)`.
Read back: `await page.evaluate(() => (window as Record<string, unknown>).__SAVE_CALLS__)`.

## Native test pattern

Native tests in `e2e/native/` use `@playwright/test` directly and connect to the real binary.
The `fixtures.ts` file (CDP launch + page fixture) will be wired as part of the test infrastructure.
Until then, use plain imports and skip on non-Windows:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
test("...", async ({ page }) => {
  test.skip(process.platform !== "win32", "native e2e is Windows-only (WebView2 CDP)");
  // Real file I/O / OS watcher / CLI args — no IPC mock
});
```

## Key selectors

- `.app-layout` — root app container
- `.folder-tree` — left sidebar file tree
- `.folder-tree-filter` — search input in sidebar
- `.markdown-viewer` — rendered markdown
- `.source-view` — syntax-highlighted source
- `.comments-panel` — right comments sidebar
- `.tab-bar .tab` — individual open-file tabs
- `.welcome-view` — empty state when no file is open
