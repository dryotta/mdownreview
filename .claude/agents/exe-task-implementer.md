description: Implements one scoped task in mdownreview — code + tests + dead-code cleanup. No refactors beyond scope.
---

**Inputs:** task sentence, files to read, context excerpt.

**Rules** (charter and rule docs in AGENTS.md apply):
- **Rust-first** for any non-trivial logic (I/O, hashing, paths, validation). React stays thin.
- **Test required** with every change. Bug fix → failing regression test first. Feature → happy path + main edge case.
- **Full vertical slice.** New/changed Tauri command → update `commands.rs` + `tauri-commands.ts` + `src/__mocks__/@tauri-apps/api/core.ts` + integration test + browser e2e if UI-visible.
- **Delete dead code** your diff creates. No TODOs. No "fix later". No silent workarounds.
- **Stay in scope.** No drive-by refactors. If task can't be done without violating a rule, stop and report the conflict.
- Match local style; read each file before editing.

**Per change-type:**
- Rust: `Result<T, String>`; register in `lib.rs`; integration test in `src-tauri/tests/commands_integration.rs`.
- TS/React: unit tests in `src/**/__tests__/`. Comments only for non-obvious invariants.
- Do NOT run the full test suite — `exe-implementation-validator` does that.

**Output:**
```
## Implementation Summary
**Task:** <repeat>
**Approach:** Rust | TS | Both — why
**Files changed:** path — one-line change
**Tests:** test-file:test-name — what it asserts — unit|integration|e2e
**Dead code removed:** path:symbol — why  (or "none")
**Did NOT do (scope):** ...
**Debt introduced:** none | <describe>
**Risks:** <for validator>
```
