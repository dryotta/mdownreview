# Test Strategy

Canonical for test layering, coverage floors, and mock hygiene. Cite violations as "violates rule N in `docs/test-strategy.md`". Charter: [`docs/principles.md`](principles.md).

## Principles

1. **Test-layer responsibility is fixed.** Every test picks the lowest layer that can prove its claim. Unit/component runs in ms; native E2E runs only in release workflow.
2. **Console silence is a first-class assertion.** A test that prints to `console.error`/`console.warn` is failing even if explicit assertions pass. Don't work around the spy — fix the noise.
3. **Every bug fix ships with a regression test that first fails.** No failing-then-passing test, no fix.
4. **IPC mocks cover every command used during app init.** Missing mocks hang the app on an unresolved Promise at startup.
5. **Fixtures are data, not code.** Fixtures live in a single tree per layer, are read-only at test time, and are never mutated across tests.

## Three-layer pyramid

| Layer | Where | What it tests | What it does NOT |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit / component** | `src/**/__tests__/`, `src-tauri/src/core/*.rs #[cfg(test)]`, `src-tauri/tests/` | Pure functions, store slices, React components in isolation, Rust core, hooks via `renderHook` | No IPC, no file I/O, no network |
| **Browser integration** | `e2e/browser/` | UI flows, keyboard shortcuts, multi-component interactions, persistence rehydration, IPC event dispatch | No real Rust, no real filesystem, no OS events |
| **Native E2E** | `e2e/native/` | Real Tauri binary + CLI args, watcher on OS events, sidecar round-trips to disk, log file creation, auto-update harness | Anything a browser test can express |

## Coverage floors

| Layer | Target | Measured? | Current |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zustand slice actions | 100% actions invoked, incl. early-return branches | No | All slices tested |
| `src/lib/*.ts` pure functions | 100% exported-symbol, 90% branch | No | All files have co-located tests |
| React components with branching render | 80% branch | No | 20 test files |
| Rust core (`src-tauri/src/core/`) | 90% line, 95% branch on `matching.rs`/`anchors.rs` | `cargo tarpaulin` not wired | 74 `#[test]` across 7 modules + 22 integration |
| Browser E2E command mock coverage | Every init command mocked in every spec | Grep-audit in CI (gap) | 101 IPC-keyword hits across 10 specs |
| Native E2E | 0 tests that could be browser tests | Manual review | 4 specs |

## Rules

### Per-layer coverage
1. Every Zustand action exported from `src/store/index.ts` has a direct unit test. (Pattern: `src/__tests__/store/recentItems.test.ts:10`.)
2. Every exported pure function in `src/lib/` has at least three tests: happy path, empty/null input, one error path.
3. Comment-matching branches (`src-tauri/src/core/matching.rs:12`) each have an integration test: exact-at-original-line, exact-elsewhere, line-fallback, fuzzy, orphan.
4. Every React component with a conditional render branch has a test per branch.
5. Component tests assert at least one user interaction (click, keyboard, typing) in addition to rendering.
6. Every user-visible error state (file missing, too large, binary, offline) has a component test asserting the specific error UI.
7. Every keyboard shortcut documented in `docs/features/` has a browser E2E test that simulates the key press and asserts the UI outcome.
8. Every anchor-line code path (exact/line/fuzzy/orphan) has an assertion in Rust unit tests and a round-trip MRSF test.

### IPC mock hygiene
9. Every browser E2E spec mocks the eleven canonical init commands: `get_launch_args`, `read_dir`, `read_text_file`, `load_review_comments`, `save_review_comments`, `check_path_exists`, `get_log_path`, `get_unresolved_counts`, `get_file_comments`, `scan_review_files`, `update_watched_files`. (`e2e/browser/fixtures/error-tracking.ts:53-66`.)
10. Safe-default fallbacks (`{}`/`[]`/`undefined`) exist for bootstrap safety only; tests whose outcome depends on a value set it explicitly.
11. IPC `invoke` mock return types are `InvokeResult`-typed so TypeScript catches mock drift. (`src/__mocks__/@tauri-apps/api/core.ts:11-25`.)
12. The `invoke` mock resets between tests (`vi.mocked(invoke).mockReset()` in `beforeEach`); mock reuse leaks IPC expectations.

### Native-test gate
13. Native E2E specs begin with a block comment explaining why the scenario cannot be a browser test. (`e2e/native/01-smoke.spec.ts:7-9`.)
14. Native E2E tests do not assert content a browser test already covers. Native-only claim = real binary + real OS event + real CLI arg + real disk write.

### Console-spy contract
15. Tests that intentionally trigger `console.error`/`console.warn` suppress with `vi.spyOn(console, "error").mockImplementation(() => {})` **inside the test body**, before the triggering action. (`src/components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx:18,33,60`.)
16. `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach` is globally applied in `src/test-setup.ts:15` — do not override locally.

### Test isolation
17. No test file shares mutable state with another. `beforeEach` resets store state (`useStore.setState({...})`) and `localStorage.clear()`. (`src/store/__tests__/tabPersistence.test.ts:5-8`.)
18. Every `#[test]` in `src-tauri/` is self-contained — uses `tempfile::NamedTempFile` or `tempdir`.

### Debounce & watcher tests
19. File-watcher save-loop debounce is tested in isolation: mock `Date.now`, assert event ignored inside the window, processed outside. Canonical window: rule 5 in [`docs/performance.md`](performance.md).
20. Ghost-entry rescan debounce is tested: multiple `deleted` events within the window coalesce to one `scanReviewFiles` call. Canonical window: rule 6 in [`docs/performance.md`](performance.md).

### Fixture hygiene
21. Fixture markdown lives under `e2e/fixtures/<feature>/` and `src-tauri/tests/fixtures/<feature>/` with kebab-case names. No fixture is edited by a test.

### Playwright imports
22. Browser tests import from `e2e/browser/fixtures/index.ts`, never `@playwright/test` directly. Native tests import from `@playwright/test` directly (different fixture semantics).

### Test-based IPC abstraction
23. Tests do not import `invoke` or `@tauri-apps/plugin-log` directly. IPC chokepoint: rule 1 in [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md). Logger chokepoint: rule 4. Tests mock the single-file mocks, not raw `invoke`.

### Pre-merge gate
24. A bug-fix PR without a failing-then-passing regression test is rejected by review. (Charter: Zero Bug Policy.)
25. `cargo test`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:e2e` all pass before a PR merges.

## Gaps

- **No CI grep-audit** verifying every browser spec mocks the eleven canonical commands.
- **No mechanical enforcement of the `mockImplementation(() => {})` scope rule.** A developer could silence globally via `beforeAll`, leaking state.
