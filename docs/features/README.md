# Feature Docs

One evergreen file per major user-facing feature area of mdownreview. The taxonomy and content rules are enforced by `.claude/agents/documentation-expert.md` on every iteration.

## Rules of this directory

- **One file per major area.** A "major area" is a user-visible capability a first-time developer needs to understand — there are ~7 of them, not 70.
- **Evergreen, not per-increment.** Each file describes the current state of the feature; historical per-PR context belongs in `CHANGELOG.md` and the git log.
- **Reference, don't duplicate.** Every file cites source by path + key class / function / command / hook name. No copied code. Readers navigate to the referenced file if they need implementation detail.
- **Link to the deep-dives.** Rules come from `docs/principles.md` + `docs/architecture.md` + `docs/performance.md` + `docs/security.md` + `docs/design-patterns.md` + `docs/test-strategy.md`. Feature docs link — they do not restate.
