# Viewer

## What it is

mdownreview renders the selected workspace file in the reading pane. It handles markdown (with GFM + Mermaid), source code with syntax highlighting and folding, structured formats (JSON, CSV, KQL plans, HTML), images, and binary files — and also knows how to show an orphaned comments view when the underlying file has been deleted.

## How it works

`ViewerRouter` inspects the file extension and routing hints (including "ghost" state from the watcher) and mounts the appropriate concrete viewer. Each concrete viewer reads content via `useFileContent`, which calls the single Rust IPC command (chokepoint: rule 1 in [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md)) and applies size/binary guards.

Markdown goes through a hardened `react-markdown` pipeline: `remark-gfm` (incl. footnotes + task lists) + `remark-github-blockquote-alert` (GitHub-style `> [!NOTE|TIP|WARNING|CAUTION|IMPORTANT]` callouts) + `rehype-raw` + `rehype-footnote-prefix` + lazy `rehype-katex` (only loaded when `HAS_MATH_RE` matches the document body, see [`docs/performance.md`](../performance.md)) + `rehype-katex-style` + `rehype-sanitize(sanitizeSchema)` + `rehype-slug` + `rehype-autolink-headings` + `@shikijs/rehype`. Plugin order is load-bearing — sanitization happens between raw HTML re-parse and any downstream plugin that injects elements, so user HTML cannot piggy-back through (rule 12 in [`docs/security.md`](../security.md)). The two narrow KaTeX preprocessors are required because KaTeX emits inline `style` attributes for math layout; `rehype-katex-style` strips `style` from any non-katex `span`/`math` so raw HTML cannot smuggle styles through. Source files go through `SourceView`, which adds line-based comment anchors, fold regions, and a local search bar. Mermaid diagrams lazy-load the Mermaid renderer through `MermaidView` so the app startup stays within the [performance budget](../performance.md), and embedded ` ```mermaid ` fenced blocks render inline through the same lazy chunk.

Per-filetype zoom (Ctrl+= / Ctrl+- / Ctrl+0) is wired through `useZoom(filetype)` and the `bumpZoom(filetype, "in"|"out"|"reset")` action — a single Zustand chokepoint that clamps to `[ZOOM_MIN, ZOOM_MAX]` and rejects non-finite inputs. The map `zoomByFiletype` (e.g. `{ ".md": 1.21, ".image": 2.0 }`) is the only viewerPrefs field that is persisted (small bounded map; persistence allowlist documented in rule 15 of [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md)). The `ImageViewer` uses pointer events with `setPointerCapture` so a drag survives moving outside the canvas, and the pan offset is clamped to the laid-out image bounds × zoom so the image cannot leave the viewport.

Remote `<img>` references are gated: the markdown viewer detects `![…](https://…)` or raw `<img src="https…">` (excluding code fences/inline ticks) and shows an "Allow remote images for this document" banner. Until the user opts in via `viewerPrefsSlice.allowRemoteImagesForDoc`, every remote image renders as a `RemoteImagePlaceholder`. Once allowed, the bytes flow through the bounded `fetch_remote_asset` Rust command (https-only, 8 MB cap, 10 s timeout, `image/*` allowlist, redirect policy capped at 5 https-only hops, semaphore-capped concurrency — rule 27 in [`docs/security.md`](../security.md)) and become `blob:` URLs, leaving the CSP `img-src` intact.

The markdown anchor handler classifies clicks into four cases: in-document `#anchor` (browser default), `javascript:`/`file:`/`data:`/`vbscript:` (dropped + warned), external `http(s)`/`mailto`/`tel` (delegated to the OS opener via `openExternalUrl`), and workspace-relative paths (resolved through `resolveWorkspacePath` for containment, then `useStore.openFile`). The HTML preview iframe applies the same four-case routing inside the safe-mode iframe.

A single Shiki highlighter instance is shared across viewers — see the Shiki singleton rule in [`docs/design-patterns.md`](../design-patterns.md). The table of contents, selection toolbar, and viewer toolbar are composable overlays, not viewer-specific code.

Markdown and HTML preview render inside a centred `.reading-width` column whose width is clamped to `--reading-width` (default 720 px, persisted in `uiSlice.readingWidth`, clamped to `[400, 1600]` by `setReadingWidth`). The viewer toolbar (Source / Visual / Wrap) is sticky-positioned at the top of its scroll container so it stays in view while the body scrolls. Two `ReadingWidthHandle` instances (left and right edges) let the user drag either side of the column outward to grow width symmetrically — a centred-column resize, not an asymmetric drag. The handle writes `--reading-width` to the container during pointermove (no React re-renders mid-drag) and only commits to the Zustand store on pointerup, so the resize stays at 60 fps regardless of body size.
