## What it is

Three collaborating surfaces: a folder tree for browsing the workspace, a tab bar for tracking open files (with persistence across sessions), and a workspace-wide search for finding files by name or content.

## How it works

Opening a workspace folder triggers one Rust call that returns the full directory tree (bounded by a depth cap and a canonicalized root per the path rules in [`docs/security.md`](../security.md)). The resulting tree populates `workspaceSlice` in Zustand; `FolderTree` renders from it via `useShallow` to avoid re-render amplification.

Clicking a file opens it in a tab — or reuses an existing tab if the file is already open. `tabsSlice` (in `src/store/tabs.ts`) tracks order, active tab, and dirty state with a hard cap of `MAX_TABS = 15` open tabs and an LRU eviction policy: when the cap is exceeded, the least-recently-accessed *non-active* tab is dropped (the active tab is never evicted). Persist middleware mirrors UI state to `localStorage` so the app rehydrates the tab set on restart. Reactive UI state lives in Zustand; ephemeral view state (scroll position, selection) stays in component-local `useState` per the stratification rule in [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md). When the strip overflows the toolbar's available width, left/right chevrons appear and scroll the strip horizontally.

Search is incremental and debounced. The query runs through `useSearch`, which coordinates a Rust scan for file-name matches with an in-memory filter for file-content hits. Results drive a filtered view of the tree without mutating the tree's source of truth.

Tab back/forward (Alt+Left, Alt+Right — #65 C1) is a session-only history stack centralized in `tabHistorySlice` (`src/store/tabHistory.ts`). The chokepoint is in `tabsSlice`: every `openFile()` and `setActiveTab()` call automatically calls `pushHistory(prevPath)` so all tab-switching paths (sidebar click, tab click, in-doc link click) record history without per-call wiring. Back/forward themselves opt out of that auto-push by passing `{ recordHistory: false }` so they don't scribble into the forward stack. The history is intentionally NOT persisted (rule 15 in [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md)). The global keyboard handler (`useGlobalShortcuts`) gates every shortcut behind an `isEditableTarget` guard so Alt+Arrow does not steal focus from inputs, contentEditable regions, or text areas.

The folder tree updates live: `useTreeWatcher` registers the root and currently-expanded folders with the Rust watcher, and `useFolderChildren` listens for `folder-changed` events to refresh cached `read_dir` entries — so files created or deleted on disk appear in the tree without the user pressing F5. The tab bar additionally surfaces an "Other files" section that lists open tabs whose paths fall outside the current workspace root, so files opened via the OS shell or CLI remain reachable while a different workspace is open.
