The contents of `docs/best-practices/` (excluding this file and `README.md`) are distilled and reproduced verbatim from the [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) repository, specifically from the `composition-patterns` and `react-best-practices` skills. Rule IDs, headings, code examples, and prose are preserved as-is to keep this documentation in lockstep with the upstream source.

Both upstream skills declare `license: MIT` in their `SKILL.md` frontmatter. © Vercel.

## Modifications

The following modifications were made when distilling upstream content into this directory:

- Sections were grouped into per-topic files (`rerender-optimization.md`, `rendering-performance.md`, etc.) instead of one monolithic `AGENTS.md`.
- Headings were rewritten from `### N.M Title` to `` ### `rule-id` -- Title `` to make rule IDs the primary anchor.
- Next.js-specific rules (e.g., `next/dynamic` from §2.4 of `react-best-practices`) were omitted because mdownreview uses Vite, not Next.js.
- React 19 rules from `composition-patterns` §4 and `react-best-practices` §8 were consolidated into `react/react19-apis.md`.
- A short header was added to each file with project context and a link back to upstream.

No code examples or rule prose were modified.
