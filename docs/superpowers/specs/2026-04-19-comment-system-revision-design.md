# Comment System Revision — Design Spec

## Problem Statement

The current comment system has two anchor types (block and line) with inconsistent UX across source and visual views. Block-based comments in the markdown visual view use content hashing which is fragile and doesn't map to source lines. Line-based comments in the source view match by `lineHash` alone, causing duplicates when identical lines exist. There is no support for selection-based comments. The comment button visibility is inconsistent between views.

This revision unifies the comment system around line-based and selection-based anchoring, ensures consistent UX in both source and visual views, fixes the duplicate comment bug, and adds shell scripts for batch comment operations.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Remove block-based comment anchoring
- Keep and fix line-based comments (compound anchor: lineNumber + lineHash)
- Add selection-based comments with text highlight
- Consistent comment UX across source view and visual view
- Floating toolbar + right-click context menu for selection comments
- Gutter `+` button for line comments in both views
- CommentsPanel (right sidebar) kept as optional/collapsible
- Selection comment visualization: gutter marker + inline text highlight
- Sidecar format v3 with migration from v2
- Shell scripts (bash + PowerShell) for scanning and cleaning comments
- Improved test coverage for comment features
- Fix all known comment bugs

**Out of scope:**
- Editing file content
- Block-based comments (being removed)
- Cloud sync or collaboration
- Comment threading (reply to comment)

## Data Model

### ReviewComment (v3)

```typescript
interface ReviewComment {
  id: string;
  anchorType: "line" | "selection";

  // Line anchor (always present — primary key for positioning)
  lineNumber: number;
  lineHash: string;           // 8-char FNV-1a hex of normalized line text

  // Selection anchor (only when anchorType === "selection")
  selectedText?: string;      // exact selected text for re-anchoring
  selectionStartOffset?: number;  // char offset within lineNumber
  selectionEndLine?: number;      // end line number (may equal lineNumber)
  selectionEndOffset?: number;    // char offset within end line

  // Comment content
  text: string;
  createdAt: string;
  resolved: boolean;
}
```

### Sidecar Format

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "comments": [...]
}
```

### Migration

- **v2 line comments** → preserved as-is (already have `lineNumber` + `lineHash`)
- **v2 block comments** → preserved in sidecar as-is with `anchorType: "block"`. Displayed at `fallbackLine` (if present) or line 1 with an orphan warning. The UI does not allow creating new block comments, but existing ones are kept until the user explicitly deletes them or runs the cleanup script.
- **v1 (legacy)** → same treatment as v2 block comments
- Sidecar version bumps to 3 on next save. All existing comments (including legacy block comments) are preserved in the saved file.

## Comment Matching Algorithm

Comments are matched to document content using a **primary + fallback** strategy:

1. **Primary match**: `lineNumber` — the comment attaches to the exact line number
2. **Validation**: check `lineHash` at `lineNumber`. If it matches, the comment is anchored
3. **Fallback (re-anchor)**: if `lineHash` doesn't match at `lineNumber`, search nearby lines (±20) for a matching hash. If found, update `lineNumber` to the new position
4. **Orphaned**: if no match found, mark as orphaned. Display at original `lineNumber` with visual warning

For selection comments, additionally:
5. **Selection validation**: check if `selectedText` exists at the expected offsets within the file content. If not, search for `selectedText` as a substring within ±20 lines of the anchored line
6. **Degraded selection**: if selection text not found, degrade to line comment display (show at line, no highlight)

### Line Hash Normalization

`lineHash` is computed by `fnv1a8()` (kept from existing code) on the line text after normalization:
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace
- Collapse internal whitespace runs to single space
- Case-sensitive (no lowercasing)

### Offset Units

All character offsets (`selectionStartOffset`, `selectionEndOffset`) use **UTF-16 code unit indices** to match JavaScript's `String.prototype.length` and DOM `Range` API behavior.

### Duplicate Hash Handling

When re-anchoring, if multiple nearby lines match the same `lineHash`:
- Prefer the line closest to the original `lineNumber`
- If equidistant, prefer the line above (lower line number)

## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
EnhancedViewer
├── SourceView (source mode)
│   ├── Line gutter with + buttons
│   ├── Inline comment threads (per-line)
│   ├── Selection highlights (overlay)
│   └── SelectionToolbar (floating, appears on text select)
├── MarkdownViewer (visual mode — markdown only)
│   ├── Block-start gutter with + buttons (mapped from DOM to source lines)
│   ├── Inline comment threads (per block-start line)
│   └── No selection comments (source view only)
├── CommentsPanel (right sidebar, optional)
│   ├── Comment list (sorted by line number)
│   ├── Filter: unresolved / all
│   └── Click-to-scroll navigation
└── Other visual views (JSON, CSV, HTML, Mermaid, KQL)
    └── Comments disabled in visualization mode (source view only)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **All comments anchor to source line numbers.** Even in visual (markdown) view, comments store the source file line number. The visual view maps rendered DOM elements back to source lines using `node.position.start.line` from react-markdown's AST.

2. **One comment per anchor.** A line comment and a selection comment on the same line are separate comments. Multiple selection comments on the same line are allowed if their selections don't overlap.

3. **Gutter is unified.** Both source and visual views use the same gutter component with `+` button. In visual view, the gutter maps to source lines via position data from the markdown AST.

4. **Selection toolbar appears on mouseup** after selecting text. It shows a single "💬 Comment" button. It disappears on click-away or escape. Position: floating above/below the selection end.

5. **Context menu** adds "Add Comment" option via right-click when text is selected.

6. **Comments in non-markdown visual views** (JSON formatter, CSV table, HTML preview, Mermaid diagram) are only available in source view mode. The visual rendering doesn't have line-level mapping.

## Comment UX Flow

### Adding a Line Comment

1. User hovers over a line → `+` button appears in the gutter
2. User clicks `+` → CommentInput opens inline below the line
3. User types comment text, presses Ctrl+Enter or clicks Save
4. Comment saved with `anchorType: "line"`, `lineNumber`, `lineHash`
5. Gutter shows comment indicator (blue dot or speech bubble icon)

### Adding a Selection Comment

1. User selects text in the document (either view)
2. On mouseup, a floating toolbar appears near the selection with "💬 Comment"
3. Alternatively, user right-clicks → context menu shows "Add Comment on Selection"
4. CommentInput opens inline at the selection start line
5. Comment saved with `anchorType: "selection"`, `lineNumber`, `lineHash`, `selectedText`, offsets
6. Selected text range highlighted with semi-transparent background
7. Gutter shows comment indicator at the start line

### Viewing Comments

- **Gutter indicators**: colored dot/icon for lines with comments. Blue = unresolved, green = resolved
- **Inline threads**: clicking the gutter indicator expands the comment thread below the line
- **Selection highlights**: semi-transparent yellow/orange background on the selected text range
- **CommentsPanel**: right sidebar lists all comments sorted by line number, click to scroll

### Resolving / Deleting

- Each comment has Resolve / Delete buttons in its thread
- Resolved comments show with muted styling and strikethrough
- CommentsPanel has a toggle to show/hide resolved comments

## Visual View Line Mapping (Markdown)

The markdown visual view needs to map rendered DOM elements back to source lines for comment positioning. This is achieved via react-markdown's `node` prop which provides `position.start.line` for each AST element.

### Strategy

1. Each rendered block element (`p`, `h1`–`h6`, `li`, `pre`, `blockquote`, `table`, etc.) receives a `data-source-line` attribute from the AST node's position
2. The gutter renders `+` buttons aligned to these block elements
3. When adding a comment, the `lineNumber` is read from `data-source-line`
4. The `lineHash` is computed from the corresponding source line text

**Limitation**: In visual view, comments can only target the **start line of a block element**, not arbitrary lines within a multi-line paragraph or code fence. For finer-grained line targeting, users should switch to source view.

### Selection in Visual View

**Selection-based comments are only available in source view.** In visual (markdown) view, the rendered HTML transforms the source text (e.g., `**bold**` → `bold`, links, images, code spans). Mapping DOM selection offsets back to reliable source character offsets is not feasible without a deep source-mapping layer. Users who need selection comments should switch to source view.

In visual view, only line-level comments are supported, anchored to the block-start line as described above.

## Removed: Block-Based Comments

The following are removed:
- `anchorType: "block"` (no new block comments created; legacy ones preserved read-only)
- `blockHash` field (not used for new comments)
- `headingContext` field (not used for new comments)
- `fallbackLine` field (replaced by `lineNumber` as primary anchor)
- `CommentMargin` component (block-level gutter — replaced by unified line gutter)
- `comment-block-wrapper` CSS class and associated hover behavior
- `makeBlock()` wrapper in MarkdownViewer
- `ListItemWithComment` wrapper in MarkdownViewer
- `buildHeadingContextMap()` utility
- `extractText()` utility for block text extraction

**Kept**: `fnv1a8()` hash function — still used for `lineHash` computation on individual lines.

## Shell Scripts

Scripts live in `scripts/` directory at the repo root. Both bash and PowerShell versions are provided. They parse `.review.json` sidecar files directly (JSON parsing via built-in tools — no external dependencies like `jq`).

### scan-comments.sh / scan-comments.ps1

Scans a directory (recursively) for `.review.json` sidecar files and displays all comments in a structured format.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/scan-comments.sh [directory]        # defaults to current dir
./scripts/scan-comments.ps1 [-Path directory]  # defaults to current dir
```

**Output format (tab-separated for easy piping):**
```
FILE	LINE	STATUS	ANCHOR	REFERENCE	COMMENT
src/app.tsx	42	unresolved	line	<line text>	This function needs error handling
src/utils.ts	15	resolved	selection	"fetchData(url)"	Consider caching
src/old.md	1	orphaned	block	<n/a>	Legacy block comment
```

**Columns:**
- `FILE` — relative path to the reviewed file (not the sidecar)
- `LINE` — `lineNumber` (or `fallbackLine` for legacy block comments, or `1` if neither)
- `STATUS` — `unresolved` / `resolved` / `orphaned`
- `ANCHOR` — `line` / `selection` / `block` (legacy)
- `REFERENCE` — for line: first 60 chars of the source line text; for selection: the `selectedText` (truncated to 60 chars); for block: `<n/a>`
- `COMMENT` — comment text with newlines replaced by `\n` literal

**Flags:**
- `--unresolved` / `-Unresolved` — show only unresolved comments
- `--resolved` / `-Resolved` — show only resolved comments
- `--json` / `-Json` — output as JSON array (for programmatic consumption)

**Edge cases:**
- Malformed JSON files: print warning to stderr, skip file, continue
- Supports sidecar versions 1, 2, and 3
- Output paths are relative to the scan directory
- Exit code 0 on success (even if no comments found), 1 on fatal error

### clean-comments.sh / clean-comments.ps1

Deletes resolved comments or all comments from sidecar files.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/clean-comments.sh [directory] [--all] [--dry-run]
./scripts/clean-comments.ps1 [-Path directory] [-All] [-DryRun]
```

**Behavior:**
- Default: removes only resolved comments from each sidecar file. If all comments were resolved, deletes the sidecar file entirely.
- `--all` / `-All`: deletes entire `.review.json` sidecar files
- `--dry-run` / `-DryRun`: shows what would be changed without modifying files
- Reports count of files modified / deleted to stdout
- Empty sidecar files (no comments remaining) are deleted rather than left as `{"version":3,"comments":[]}`

**Edge cases:**
- Malformed JSON files: print warning to stderr, skip file, continue
- Supports sidecar versions 1, 2, and 3 (preserves version on rewrite)
- Bash version uses Python one-liner for JSON parsing (`python3 -c ...`) since bash has no built-in JSON support
- PowerShell version uses `ConvertFrom-Json` / `ConvertTo-Json` (built-in)
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on fatal error

## CSS Design

### Comment Gutter (Both Views)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [+] │ 1 │ import React from 'react';     │  ← source view
│     │ 2 │ import { useState } from ...   │
│ [💬]│ 3 │ function App() {               │  ← has comment
│     │ 4 │   const [x, setX] = ...        │
│ [+] │ 5 │   return <div>hello</div>;     │  ← hover shows +
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- `+` button: appears on hover, always at left edge (no indentation)
- Comment indicator: small icon, always visible for lines with comments
- Both views use the same `.comment-gutter` component

### Selection Highlight

```css
.comment-selection-highlight {
  background: rgba(255, 186, 0, 0.2);  /* semi-transparent yellow */
  border-bottom: 2px solid rgba(255, 186, 0, 0.6);
  border-radius: 2px;
}

.comment-selection-highlight.resolved {
  background: rgba(0, 180, 0, 0.1);
  border-bottom-color: rgba(0, 180, 0, 0.3);
}
```

### Floating Selection Toolbar

```css
.selection-toolbar {
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 100;
  background: var(--color-bg-elevated);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
  border-radius: 6px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
  padding: 4px 8px;
}
```

Positioned dynamically above or below the selection using `window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0).getBoundingClientRect()`.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

1. **Comment matching algorithm** — test primary match, re-anchoring, orphaning
2. **Selection anchor creation** — test offset computation, multi-line selections
3. **Sidecar migration** — test v1→v3, v2→v3, block comment orphaning
4. **Store actions** — addComment, editComment, deleteComment, resolveComment with new model
5. **Line hash computation** — test normalization and collision handling
6. **CommentsPanel** — test sorting, filtering, click-to-scroll

### Component Tests (Vitest + RTL)

1. **CommentInput** — test Ctrl+Enter save, Escape cancel, empty rejection
2. **CommentThread** — test resolve/unresolve, edit, delete
3. **SelectionToolbar** — test appearance on selection, disappearance on click-away
4. **Gutter** — test `+` button hover, comment indicator rendering
5. **Selection highlights** — test highlight rendering for selection comments

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

1. **Add line comment** in source view → verify persisted in sidecar
2. **Add selection comment** in source view → verify highlight + sidecar
3. **Add line comment** in visual (markdown) view → verify source line mapping
4. **Duplicate line handling** — two identical lines, comment on one → only one shows
5. **Re-anchoring** — change file, reopen → comment re-anchors to moved line
6. **CommentsPanel navigation** — click comment → scrolls to correct line
7. **Resolve/delete** — verify UI update and sidecar persistence

### Rust Integration Tests

1. **Sidecar v3 round-trip** — save and load with new fields
2. **v2 migration** — load v2 file, verify comments preserved
3. **Atomic save** — verify temp+rename behavior
